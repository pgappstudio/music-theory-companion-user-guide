# Metronome
The metronome tool is used in music to maintain a consistent tempo (speed) by producing regular clicks or beats at a specified beats per minute (BPM). Musicians use metronomes for practicing, rehearsing in groups, and ensuring precise timing during performances.

## How to use

* Enable/disable playing first beat accent as needed.
* Select the percussion instruments for beat/accent-beat/sub-beat sounds from the respective drop-downs.
* Set time signature from the drop-downs.
* Set beat subdivision from the drop-down.
* Set tempo BPM with tap, pressing +/- buttons or sliding the slider.
* Enable the Speed Trainer switch for increasing/decreasing the tempo at a configured interval.
* Tap the Start/Stop button to start/stop the metronome.
* Beat number and measure number are displayed when metronome is running.

**Note**: The Speed Trainer function works only when the metronome tool screen is active.
