# Scales and Diatonic Chords
The Scales & Diatonic Chords tool is used for studying how Diatonic-Chords (Triad and 7th) are formed for different scales on any selected Key/Root.

## How to use
* Select Root/Key from the top-left dropdown.
* Select Scale from the top-right dropdown.
* Play the Scale notes can by tapping the Scale Notes area.
* Play the Chords by tapping the triad or 7th chords.
* I, IV and V triads and 7th chords (marked with box) are minimal chords that can be used to harmonize any scale notes.
* Chords marked with same colour can be used as alternate/replacement to any chord, to overcome monotonous chord progression.
* Enable the REPEAT button for playing the selected chord repetitively along with Metronome beat when Metronome is running.
* Selected Chord notes are displayed on the Piano/Guitar-fretboard/Staff.
