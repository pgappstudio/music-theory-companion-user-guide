# Cube Dance
Welcome to the Cube Dance Tool! This feature is designed for exploring modern voice leading based on Neo-Riemannian theory. Developed by Jack Douthett, the Cube Dance Tool offers a unique approach to chord progressions by using geometric relationships among triads and augmented chords. It's perfect for composers and musicians looking to experiment with innovative voice leading and harmonic transitions.

## What You Can Do with the Cube Dance Tool
* **Explore Voice Leading**: Discover smooth and interesting voice leading through geometric relationships between chords.
* **Experiment with Chords**: Test different chord progressions and transitions using the Cube Dance framework.
* **Visualize Chord Relationships**: Understand how different triads and chords are interconnected.

## Features
* **Geometric Representation**: Displays chords as vertices in a geometric model, allowing you to see their relationships and transitions.
* **Chord Playback**: Play chords to hear how they sound and how they connect within the Cube Dance framework.
* **Visual Guidance**: Provides visual aids to help you understand the voice leading between chords.

## How to Use the Cube Dance Tool
1. **Play Chords**:
    * Tap on any chord within the Cube Dance model to hear its sound. This helps you understand how each chord fits into the overall voice leading framework.
1. **Understand Chord Relationships**:
    * Chords are represented as vertices in a geometric space. Use the visual representation to see how chords relate to each other and explore different transitions.
1. **Experiment with Progressions**:
    * Create and test various chord progressions within the Cube Dance model. Observe how different chords interact and how smooth the transitions are.
1. **Play Last Selected Chord**:
    * Tap the PLAY button to play the last selected chord. This feature is useful for focusing on specific chords and their transitions.
1. **Use Visuals for Guidance**:
    * Utilize the visual model to guide your experimentation and understand how the geometric relationships affect voice leading.

## Quick Tips
* **Familiarize with Neo-Riemannian Theory**: Understanding the basics of Neo-Riemannian theory will help you make the most of the Cube Dance Tool.
* **Experiment Freely**: Donâ€™t hesitate to try various chord progressions and transitions to see how they fit within the Cube Dance framework.
* **Utilize Visuals**: The geometric model is a powerful tool for visualizing chord relationships and smooth voice leading.

## Practical Uses
* **Composition**: Ideal for composers seeking innovative and smooth voice leading in their music.
* **Theory Exploration**: Useful for musicians and students exploring advanced harmonic concepts and geometric relationships in music.
* **Creative Experimentation**: Helps musicians experiment with unconventional harmonic ideas and improve their compositional techniques.

By using the Cube Dance Tool, you can dive into the world of modern voice leading and enhance your compositions with fresh and creative harmonic ideas. Enjoy your exploration!
