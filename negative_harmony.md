## How to Use the Negative Harmony Tool
1. **Select Root/Key**:
    * Use the top-left dropdown menu to choose the root or key for the scale or chord you want to analyze.
1. **Select Scale**:
    * Choose the scale from the top-right dropdown menu. The tool will display the scale notes and their negative harmony counterparts.
1. **Play Chromatic Notes**:
    * Tap on the chromatic notes to hear their negative harmony equivalents. This helps you understand how each note is transformed in negative harmony.
1. **Play Scale Notes and Chords**:
    * Select scale notes or chords to see their negative harmony counterparts. Tap on them to hear the transformed version and how it differs from the original.
1. **Enable Repeat**:
    * If you want the notes or chords to play repetitively along with the metronome, enable the REPEAT button.
1. **Use the Metronome**:
    * Sync your practice with the metronome to maintain a consistent tempo. Adjust the metronome settings as needed for your practice session.

## Quick Tips
* **Understand the Concept**: Familiarize yourself with the theory behind negative harmony to better appreciate its application and effects.
* **Experiment with Transformations**: Try different scales and chords to see how negative harmony changes their character and relationships.
* **Use Visuals**: Utilize the piano, guitar fretboard, and staff views to see how negative harmony is applied and how it alters harmonic structures.

## Practical Uses
* **Composition**: Ideal for composers looking to incorporate negative harmony into their music for a unique harmonic perspective.
* **Theory Exploration**: Useful for students and musicians exploring advanced harmonic concepts and their applications.
* **Creative Experimentation**: Helps musicians experiment with unconventional harmonic ideas and transform traditional progressions.
