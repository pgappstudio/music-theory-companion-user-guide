# Scale Practice
The Scale Practice tool is used for practicing (vocal or instrument) any scale on any selected Key/Root.

## How to use
* Select desired Root/Key from the top-left dropdown or by rotating the notes displayed along the circle.
* Select the Scale that you want to practice from the top-right dropdown. Scale notes are highlighted with color along the circle.
* A small red arrow points to the played note on the circle when singing or playing any instrument note.
* Play the highlighted scale notes by tapping on them.
* If playing chord (triad or 7th) is enabled then, chords corresponding to the tapped note is played instead of the note.
* Enable the REPEAT button for playing the selected chord repetitively along with Metronome beat when Metronome is running.
* Selected Chord notes are displayed on the Piano/Guitar-fretboard/Staff.
