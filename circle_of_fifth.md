# Circle of Fifths
Welcome to the Circle of Fifths Tool! This feature is designed to help you understand and apply the Circle of Fifths and Circle of Fourths in your music. It’s a powerful resource for learning key signatures, chord relationships, and scale structures.

## What is Circle of Fifths
In music theory, the circle of fifths is a way of organizing the 12 chromatic pitches as a sequence of perfect fifths. If C is chosen as a starting point, the sequence is: C, G, D, A, E, B (=C♭), F♯ (=G♭), C♯ (=D♭), A♭, E♭, B♭, F. Continuing the pattern from F returns the sequence to its starting point of C. This order places the most closely related key signatures adjacent to one another. It is usually illustrated in the form of a circle.
